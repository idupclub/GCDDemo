# A simple demo for Grand Central Dispatch in Swift 3

In Swift 3 things have dramatically changed. The way GCD is used is brand new, totally Swift-like, and the new syntax makes it a lot easier for developers to get familiarised with it. These changes gave me the motivation to write a post about the most basic and important things one can do with GCD in Swift 3. If you were using GCD with its old coding style (even a little), then this whole new syntax will seem like a piece of cake; if not, then youâ€™re just about to learn about a new programming chapter.
